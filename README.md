**Blog Posts**
- [Uncovering the Sysrv-Hello Crypto-Jacking Bonet, May 25, 2022](https://www.darktrace.com/blog/worm-like-propagation-of-sysrv-hello-crypto-jacking-botnet)
  - **Situation**: While working in the MDR SOC, I was responsible for monitoring, assessing active compromises affecting customer environments and informing them.
  - **Task**: My task was to thoroughly assess the incident, identify the attacker’s techniques, and provide customers (typically security engineers) with clear, actionable insights, along with technical proof of the product working well in detecting threats for POCs.
  - **Action**: During the investigation of the initial alert I did not just stop at determining true/false positive, but I dug much deeper and also went into Darktrace advanced search (NDR logs) to pivot off indicators to unveil the whole sequence of compromise at the network level via Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK in a blog post.
  - **Result**: As one of the first few blog writers for the 'Inside the SOC' blog series, it also demonstrated initiative and comfort operating in ambiguity — I wasn’t just closing alerts but in addition, providing value to marketing, sales and customers, enabling others. Top article in Google search result for this particular botnet variant (sysrv-hello), which uses victim's computer processing power to mine cryptocurrency. DT also promotes this blog series on LinkedIn nowadays.
